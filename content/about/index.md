Are you tired of spending countless hours debating the finer points of [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/)? Do you find yourself wanting to adjust the meaning of bug vs feature just to fit a versioning scheme or marketing goal?

Is your date based versioning schema too complicated because it gives users nearly no context as to what may have changed in your software?

Do you wish that somehow you could version not only your software, but your entire application stack, web addresses or even chat rooms? Well, look no further and enter, -new versionig (pronounced dash-new-ver).

### How it works

Versioning Rule 1: When you have a version of something, and need a new version, simply append `-new` as a suffix.

As an example, if your old web mail URI was [http://mail.example.com](http://mail.example.com),  the new version on new hardware with all sorts of great bells and whistles would be at [http://mail-new.example.com](http://mail-new.example.com).

### Scaling Dashnewver
Dashnewver is a simple versioning schema first used at a Fortune 50 company, but then adopted by open source projects, startups and growth companies  -- so you know it scales.

What happens when another newer version comes? Simple: you apply Rule 1 again.
